GitHub Action to setup Vim and Neovim
=====================================
[![Build status][ci-badge]][ci]
[![Action Marketplace][release-badge]][marketplace]

[action-setup-vim][proj] is an action for [GitHub Actions][github-actions] to setup [Vim][vim] or
[Neovim][neovim] on Linux, macOS and Windows. Stable releases, nightly releases and specifying
versions are supported.

For stable releases, this action will install Vim or Neovim from system's package manager or
official releases since it is the most popular way to install them and it's faster than building
from source.

For nightly release, this action basically installs the nightly release of Vim or Neovim from
official releases. If unavailable, it builds executables from sources.

For more details, please read the following 'Installation details' section.

## Why?

Since preparing Vim editor is highly depending on a platform. On Linux, Vim is usually installed via
system's package manager like `apt`. On macOS, MacVim is the most popular Vim distribution and
usually installed via Homebrew. On Windows, [official installers][win-inst] are provided.

Neovim provides releases [on GitHub][neovim-release] and system package managers.

If you're an author of Vim and/or Neovim plugin and your plugin has some tests, you'd like to run
them across platforms on Vim and/or Neovim. action-setup-vim will help the installation with only
one step. You don't need to separate workflow jobs for each platforms and Vim/Neovim.

## Usage

Install the latest stable Vim:

```yaml
- uses: rhysd/action-setup-vim@v1
```

Install the latest nightly Vim:

```yaml
- uses: rhysd/action-setup-vim@v1
  with:
    version: nightly
```

Install the latest Vim v8.1.123. The version is a tag name in [vim/vim][vim] repository. Please see
the following 'Choosing a specific version' section as well:

```yaml
- uses: rhysd/action-setup-vim@v1
  with:
    version: v8.1.0123
```

When you want to customize the build configuration for Vim, `configure-args` input is available.
The input is passed to `./configure` option when building Vim from source:

```yaml
- uses: rhysd/action-setup-vim@v1
  with:
    version: nightly
    configure-args: |
      --with-features=huge --enable-fail-if-missing --disable-nls
```

Install the latest stable Neovim:

```yaml
- uses: rhysd/action-setup-vim@v1
  with:
    neovim: true
```

Install the latest nightly Neovim:

```yaml
- uses: rhysd/action-setup-vim@v1
  with:
    neovim: true
    version: nightly
```

Install the Neovim v0.4.3. Please see the following 'Choosing a specific version' section as well:

```yaml
- uses: rhysd/action-setup-vim@v1
  with:
    neovim: true
    version: v0.4.3
```

After the setup, `vim` executable will be available for Vim and `nvim` executable will be available
for Neovim.

Real-world examples are workflows in [clever-f.vim][clever-f-workflow] and
[git-messenger.vim][git-messenger-workflow]. And you can see [this repository's CI workflows][ci].
They run this action with all combinations of the inputs.

For comprehensive lists of inputs and outputs, please refer [action.yml](./action.yml).

## Outputs

This action sets installed executable path to the action's `executable` output. You can use it for
running Vim command in the steps later.

Here is an example to set Vim executable to run unit tests with [themis.vim][vim-themis].

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    repository: thinca/vim-themis
    path: vim-themis
- uses: rhysd/action-setup-vim@v1
  id: vim
- name: Run unit tests with themis.vim
  env:
    THEMIS_VIM: ${{ steps.vim.outputs.executable }}
  run: |
    ./vim-themis/bin/themis ./test
```

## Installation details

### Vim

`vX.Y.Z` represents a specific version such as `v8.2.0126`.

| OS      | Version   | Installation                                                                |

| Linux   | `nightly` | Build the HEAD of [vim/vim][vim] repository                                 |
| Linux   | `vX.Y.Z`  | Build the `vX.Y.Z` tag of [vim/vim][vim] repository                         |
| macOS   | `stable`  | Install MacVim via `brew install macvim`                                    |
| macOS   | `nightly` | Build the HEAD of [vim/vim][vim] repository                                 |
| macOS   | `vX.Y.Z`  | Build the `vX.Y.Z` tag of [vim/vim][vim] repository                         |
| Windows | `stable`  | There is no stable release for Windows so fall back to `nightly`            |
| Windows | `nightly` | Install the latest release from [the installer repository][win-inst]        |
| Windows | `vX.Y.Z`  | Install the release at `vX.Y.Z` tag of [the installer repository][win-inst] |

For stable releases on all platforms and nightly on Windows, `gvim` executable is also available.

When installing without system's package manager, Vim is installed at `$HOME/vim`.

**Note:** When you build Vim older than 8.2.1119 on macOS, Xcode 11 or earlier is necessary due to
lack of [this patch][vim_8_2_1119]. Please try `macos-11` runner instead of the latest macOS runner
in the case.

### Neovim

`vX.Y.Z` represents a specific version such as `v0.4.3`.

| OS      | Version   | Installation                                                              |
|---------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux   | `stable`  | Install from the latest [Neovim stable release][nvim-stable]              |
| Linux   | `nightly` | Install from the latest [Neovim nightly release][nvim-nightly]            |
| Linux   | `vX.Y.Z`  | Install the release at `vX.Y.Z` tag of [neovim/neovim][neovim] repository |
| macOS   | `stable`  | `brew install neovim` using Homebrew                                      |
| macOS   | `nightly` | Install from the latest [Neovim nightly release][nvim-nightly]            |
| macOS   | `vX.Y.Z`  | Install the release at `vX.Y.Z` tag of [neovim/neovim][neovim] repository |
| Windows | `stable`  | Install from the latest [Neovim stable release][nvim-stable]              |
| Windows | `nightly` | Install from the latest [Neovim nightly release][nvim-nightly]            |
| Windows | `vX.Y.Z`  | Install the release at `vX.Y.Z` tag of [neovim/neovim][neovim] repository |

Only on Windows, `nvim-qt.exe` executable is available for GUI.

When installing without system's package manager, Neovim is installed at `$HOME/nvim`.

**Note:** Ubuntu 18.04 supports official [`neovim` package][ubuntu-nvim] but this action does not
install it. As of now, GitHub Actions also supports Ubuntu 16.04.

**Note:** When downloading a Neovim asset from [`stable` release][nvim-stable] on GitHub, the asset
is rarely missing in the release. In the case, this action will get the latest version tag from
GitHub API and use it instead of `stable` tag (see [#5][issue-5] for more details).

**Note:** When downloading a Neovim asset from [`nightly` release][nvim-nightly] on GitHub, it might
cause 'Asset Not Found' error. This is because the Nightly build failed due to some reason in
[neovim/neovim][neovim] CI workflow. In the case, this action tries to build Neovim from sources on
Linux and macOS workers. It gives up installation on other platforms.

## Choosing a specific version

### Vim

If Vim is built from source, any tag version should be available.

If Vim is installed via release asset (on Windows), please check
[vim-win32-installer releases page][win-inst-release] to know which versions are available.
The repository makes a release once per day (nightly).

Note that Vim's patch number in version tags is in 4-digits like `v8.2.0126`. Omitting leading
zeros such as `v8.2.126` or `v8.2.1` is not allowed.

### Neovim

When installing the specific version of Neovim, this action downloads release assets from
[neovim/neovim][neovim]. Please check [neovim/neovim releases page][neovim-release] to know which
versions have release assets. For example,
[Neovim 0.4.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.4.0) has no Windows releases so it
is not available for installing Neovim on Windows.

## Current limitation

- GUI version (gVim and nvim-qt) is supported partially as described in above section.
- Installing Vim/Neovim from system's package manager is not configurable. For example, arguments
  cannot be passed to `brew install`.

These are basically not a technical limitation. Please let me know by creating an issue if you want
some of them.
